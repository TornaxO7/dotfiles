Welcome to my dotfiles!

## For Non-Nix Users
There are also dotfiles for you! Just look after directories which are named
`config`. For example the [`config/`] directory in my repository, there are
my "real" dotfiles which you might more expect.

## For Nix-Users
I've also included some custom packages (`pkgs`), NixOS modules (`nixosModules`) and home manager modules (`homeManagerModules`).
